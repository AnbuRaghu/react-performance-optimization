In class components, the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method allows you to control whether a component should re-render based on changes in props or state. In functional components, there isn't a direct equivalent, but you can achieve similar functionality using hooks, particularly the **`React.memo`** and **`useMemo`** hooks.

### Using `React.memo`

**`React.memo`** is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component, preventing it from re-rendering if its props haven’t changed. It works similarly to `shouldComponentUpdate`.

#### Example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// Functional component wrapped in React.memo
const MyComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  console.log('Rendering MyComponent');

  return <div>{data}</div>;
});

// Parent component
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const [data, setData] = React.useState('Hello, World!');

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <MyComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

### How It Works:
- In this example, `MyComponent` is wrapped in `React.memo`, which means it will only re-render if the `data` prop changes.
- When the **Increment Count** button is clicked, the count state changes, but `MyComponent` will not re-render unless `data` changes, thus avoiding unnecessary renders.

### Using `useMemo` and `useCallback`

In addition to `React.memo`, you can optimize re-renders further using the **`useMemo`** and **`useCallback`** hooks.

- **`useMemo`**: Memoizes a computed value to prevent recalculation on every render.

  ```jsx
  const memoizedValue = React.useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(data), [data]);
  ```

- **`useCallback`**: Returns a memoized version of a callback function that only changes if one of its dependencies has changed. This is useful for passing functions to child components that might otherwise cause unnecessary re-renders.

  ```jsx
  const memoizedCallback = React.useCallback(() => {
    doSomething(data);
  }, [data]);
  ```

### Example with `useMemo` and `useCallback`

Here’s how you can use both hooks together:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ value }) => {
  console.log('Expensive Component Rendered');
  return <div>{value}</div>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(0);

  const computedValue = React.useMemo(() => {
    return data * 2; // Expensive computation
  }, [data]);

  const handleChange = React.useCallback(() => {
    setData(data + 1);
  }, [data]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={handleChange}>Change Data</button>
      <ExpensiveComponent value={computedValue} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

### Key Points:
- **`React.memo`** prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing functional components based on props.
- **`useMemo`** helps optimize expensive calculations, only recalculating when dependencies change.
- **`useCallback`** can help ensure functions don’t get recreated on every render unless their dependencies change, which can help in passing functions to memoized child components.

### Conclusion:
While functional components do not have a direct equivalent to `shouldComponentUpdate`, you can effectively control re-renders and optimize performance using **`React.memo`**, **`useMemo`**, and **`useCallback`**. This allows you to avoid unnecessary rendering and improve the performance of your React applications.

The line:

```jsx
const computedValue = React.useMemo(() => {
    return data * 2; // Expensive computation
}, [data]);
```

is using the **`useMemo`** hook in React to optimize performance by **memoizing** the result of a computation. Let’s break it down:

### What `useMemo` Does:
- **`useMemo`** is a hook that memoizes a value, meaning it **remembers** the result of a computation and **only recalculates** it when its dependencies change.
- The first argument to `useMemo` is a function that performs a computation (in this case, `data * 2`).
- The second argument is an array of dependencies `[data]`. **`useMemo`** will recompute the result **only if `data` changes**. If `data` stays the same, it will return the memoized (cached) result from the previous render.

### In Detail:
- **Computation:** `data * 2` is a simple multiplication here, but in real-world scenarios, the computation inside `useMemo` could be something much more expensive (e.g., a large loop, complex calculation, or even a fetch operation).
  
- **Memoization:** Normally, React would run the computation every time the component re-renders, even if `data` hasn't changed. But with `useMemo`, React will only perform the computation when `data` changes. If `data` is the same between renders, `useMemo` will skip recalculating and return the previously computed value, improving performance.

### Example Breakdown:
1. **Initial Render**: Suppose `data` is initially `5`. The `useMemo` hook will compute `5 * 2`, returning `10`, and `computedValue` will be set to `10`.
   
2. **Subsequent Renders**: If the component re-renders but `data` hasn't changed (still `5`), `useMemo` will **not recalculate** `5 * 2`. Instead, it will return the memoized result `10` from the previous render.

3. **Data Change**: If `data` changes (e.g., `data = 7`), the function inside `useMemo` will run again, and `7 * 2` will be calculated, resulting in `computedValue = 14`.

### Why Use It?
In React, especially with functional components, re-renders are frequent. Without `useMemo`, every time the component re-renders, it would recompute `data * 2` even if `data` didn’t change. For simple operations like this, the performance impact is minimal, but for **expensive computations**, recomputing on every render could significantly degrade performance.

By using `useMemo`, you ensure that the computation only happens when necessary (i.e., when the dependencies change), thus **optimizing performance**.

### Summary:
- **`useMemo`** memoizes the result of an expensive or repetitive computation, improving performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.
- The computation will only be re-executed when the values in the dependency array (in this case, `[data]`) change.
