we can use a package called why-did-you-update to check unneccessary renders in dev memoized
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------









Ah, I see! The package **`why-did-you-update`** is a helpful tool for React developers. Here’s an overview of what it does and why it might be useful:

### What is `why-did-you-update`?

**`why-did-you-update`** is a library designed to help developers understand why a React component is re-rendering. It acts as a performance optimization tool, providing insights into unnecessary re-renders, which can lead to performance issues in React applications.

### Key Features:

1. **Detects Unnecessary Re-renders**:
   - The main functionality of `why-did-you-update` is to log messages in the console when a component re-renders unnecessarily. This allows you to identify components that are re-rendering without a change in their props or state.

2. **Helpful Logging**:
   - When a component re-renders, `why-did-you-update` will print a detailed message that shows which props have changed and why the component decided to re-render. This includes comparisons of the old props and new props.

3. **Integration with React**:
   - It can be easily integrated into existing React applications by wrapping your components or the entire app in the provided higher-order component (HOC) or using the provided utility methods.

4. **Improves Performance**:
   - By identifying unnecessary re-renders, developers can optimize their components by implementing memoization (e.g., using `React.memo`) or by refactoring components to minimize props passed down.

### How to Use `why-did-you-update`

To use `why-did-you-update`, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Package**:
   You can install it via npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install @welldone-software/why-did-you-update
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn add @welldone-software/why-did-you-update
   ```

2. **Set Up in Your Application**:
   You can set it up in your application’s entry point (e.g., `index.js` or `App.js`).

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import App from './App';
   import whyDidYouUpdate from '@welldone-software/why-did-you-update';

   // Initialize the library
   whyDidYouUpdate(React);

   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

3. **Check the Console for Logs**:
   When you run your application, the console will display logs when components re-render, detailing which props have changed.

### Example Usage

Here’s a simple example to illustrate how `why-did-you-update` works:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import whyDidYouUpdate from '@welldone-software/why-did-you-update';

whyDidYouUpdate(React);

const Counter = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log('Counter rendered');
  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
});

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState('Hello');

  return (
    <div>
      <Counter count={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(otherState === 'Hello' ? 'World' : 'Hello')}>
        Change Other State
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### What Happens:

- When you click the **Increment** button, the `Counter` component should only re-render if `count` changes.
- If you click the **Change Other State** button, the `Counter` component should **not** re-render, and `why-did-you-update` will help confirm this by not logging a render for the `Counter` component.

### Benefits of Using `why-did-you-update`

- **Performance Monitoring**: It helps you monitor the performance of your React components in real-time.
- **Optimization Guidance**: By identifying unnecessary re-renders, it guides you on where to apply optimizations in your code.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: It improves the debugging experience by providing clear insights into component behavior.

### Conclusion

**`why-did-you-update`** is a valuable tool for React developers focused on performance optimization. By helping identify unnecessary re-renders, it allows developers to write more efficient React applications, ultimately leading to better user experiences.
------------------------------------------------



You are correct! The **`why-did-you-update`** package should only be used in a **development environment**. It is designed primarily for debugging and performance optimization during the development phase, and it can introduce overhead if used in a production environment. 

### Best Practices for Using `why-did-you-update`

Here’s how you can ensure that **`why-did-you-update`** is only included in your development environment:

1. **Conditional Import**:
   You can conditionally import and initialize `why-did-you-update` based on the environment. This can be done by checking the `NODE_ENV` variable.

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import App from './App';

   // Only import why-did-you-update in development
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
     const whyDidYouUpdate = require('@welldone-software/why-did-you-update');
     whyDidYouUpdate(React);
   }

   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variables**:
   Ensure your build process sets the `NODE_ENV` variable correctly. For instance, most build tools (like Webpack, Create React App, etc.) will set `NODE_ENV` to `production` when you build your app for production.

3. **Avoiding Unwanted Logs**:
   By using `why-did-you-update` only in development, you prevent any performance impact or logging clutter in your production logs.

### Example with Full Component

Here’s a complete example of how to conditionally use `why-did-you-update` in a React application:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

// Check if we are in a development environment
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  const whyDidYouUpdate = require('@welldone-software/why-did-you-update');
  whyDidYouUpdate(React);
}

const Counter = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log('Counter rendered');
  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
});

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState('Hello');

  return (
    <div>
      <Counter count={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(otherState === 'Hello' ? 'World' : 'Hello')}>
        Change Other State
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Summary
- **`why-did-you-update`** is an invaluable tool for identifying unnecessary re-renders in React applications but should **only be used in development**.
- **Conditional loading** based on the `NODE_ENV` variable ensures that it does not affect production performance or generate unnecessary logs.
- Following this practice helps maintain an efficient and clean production environment while still leveraging powerful debugging tools during development.
